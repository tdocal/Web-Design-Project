                <h2>Reported Cases of Chlamydia in 2016</h2>
                <!--<h2>Median Home Value vs. Median Household Income</h2>-->
                <p>This map shows the number of cases of chlamydia reported in 2016, according to the CDC. Choose the census division from the list on the bottom left to see the breakdown of reported cases in each region of the country.<br><br>The height of each county represents the number of cases reported, while the color depth represents the percentage of each county's population that was diagnosed with chlamydia.<br><br>It is possible to load every region at the same time, however, it requires 16GB of RAM and I don't think it's a reasonable assumption that everyone has that much. So, I've broken the map down into pieces that can be selected one at a time. In the future I will add similar maps of other STDs as reported by the CDC as well as a timeline that shows the increase in reported cases over time. However, that is not something I will be able to accomplish by the end of the semester.</p>

The darker the color the greater the disparity between home value and household income.</p>
